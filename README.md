# WeatherAirQuality_Streamlit_WebApp
Developed a web application using the Streamlit framework to display the weather conditions and air quality index of a specified city in the world. The application will use three different endpoints of the Air Quality Index API by AirVisual to provide three different methods for users to specify the location.
